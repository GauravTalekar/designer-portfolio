    "project-description": <><p>An illustrative project revolving around women with lotus as metaphor for drawing a parallelism</p><p>in context to the message of positivity and strength. Lotus has been considered since ages as a symbol of sacred feminine element for beauty, fertility, and prosperity of the soul.</p><p>Lotus is a symbol for being unattached with the world, yet represents the possibility of blooming in the darkest clouds, much like how every woman has been an inspiring ray through an</p><p>undiscovered way. The lotus embodies all that exists around it, with its petals reaching towards the sky in perfect unity. Similarly, every woman gathers the courage and strength to push past her limits and give her best to the world. For one shall be deluded by its origin of the lotus, but not by its destiny. Although its origin may be misconstrued, the destiny of a woman is not to be underestimated. She has always been an element of the sun for her splendor force to support whole life, likewise Lotus in many cultures has been associated with sun and fire element. An artistic practice grounded on parallel lines and rising to a form of oneness, I would like to dedicate my illustrative artwork to the Excellency of every woman.</p></>,

But it was not just the physical comforts of the red chair that made it so beloved. It was the people behind it, the tireless chefs and servers who worked tirelessly to create dishes that not only satisfied hunger but also lifted the spirits.</p></>,
